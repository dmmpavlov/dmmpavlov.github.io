## Dmitrii Pavlov

I am a first year PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig under the supervision of Bernd Sturmfels. Before that I was a masters student at Moscow State University, where my advisors were Gleb Pogudin and Yury Razmyslov. I am broadly interested in applied algebra with a particular interest in differential algebra.

Here is my [CV](https:\\dmmpavlov.github.io/CV.pdf).
