## Dmitrii Pavlov

I am a first year PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https:\\mis.mpg.de) in Leipzig under the supervision of [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/). Before that I was a masters student at Moscow State University, where my advisors were [Gleb Pogudin](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Gleb.POGUDIN/) and Yury Razmyslov. I am broadly interested in applied algebra with a particular interest in differential algebra.

Here is my [CV](https:\\dmmpavlov.github.io/CV_Pavlov.pdf).
