## About me

<img align="right" width="174" height="230" src="docs/assets/images/PH.jpg">

I am a first year PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig under the supervision of [Bernd Sturmfels](https://math.berkeley.edu/~bernd/) and [Simon Telen](https://simontelen.webnode.page/). Before that, I was a masters student at Moscow State University, where my advisors were [Gleb Pogudin](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Gleb.POGUDIN/) and Yury Razmyslov. I am broadly interested in applied algebra with a particular interest in differential algebra and real algebraic geometry.



Here is my [CV](https://dmmpavlov.github.io/CV_Pavlov_aug.pdf).
